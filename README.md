DSS Test Task
=============

The code from this assignment was taken from the actual project files.

Your goal is to remake `dss_letters.php` into a micro-SPA (Single Page Application) with an API backend, Javascript 
frontend, and (preferably) acceptance tests.

You can use any PHP framework you prefer (the DSS application uses Laravel, but this is not required here).
You can use any frontend framework you prefer (the DSS application uses Vue.js, but this is not required here).
You can use any acceptance test framework you prefer. If you want to include other levels of testing, you are
welcome to do so.

HTML may be remade as a part of this assignment, but any changes should be done in a way that does not prevent the same
acceptance test from passing on both old and new versions of code. Links to other pages should be rewritten
as Vue routes, but there is no need to create actual routing configuration.

This is purely a coding assignment. You do not need to configure a server or demonstrate if the application actually
works in browser. Some of the tests you write may fail because of this, that is not a problem as far as this
task is concerned. However, we would prefer that you polish the code to be clean and beautiful.

You should create a repository (or repositories) on your Github account or any other VCS account with
publicly-accessible web interface and upload the result there.
